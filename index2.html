  <p>
    carbohydrate are energy giving food  They provide energy in the form of calories that the body needs to be able to work, and to support other functions.
    Carbohydrates are needed in large amounts by the body. Indeed, up to 65% of our energy comes from carbohydrates They are the bodyâ€™s main source of fuel
    because they are easily converted into energy.This energy is usually in the form of glucose, which all tissues and cells in our bodies readily use.

    <p>
    About 10â€“35% of calories should come from protein. Proteins are needed in our diets for growth (especially important for children, teens and pregnant women) and
    to improve immune functions.They also play an important role in making essential hormones and enzymes,
    in tissue repair, preserving lean muscle mass, and supplying energy in times when carbohydrates are not available

      Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy and so are important nutrients for young children who need a lot of energy-rich food.
      Fats can also make meals more tasty and satisfying. Fat is found in meat, chicken, milk products, butters, creams, avocado,
      cooking oils and fats, cheese, fish and ground nuts.

  <p>
    You may remember from Study Session 1 that a 50 kg adult contains about 31 litres of water and a one year old, 10 kg child contains nearly
    8 litres of water. Almost every part of the body contains large amounts of water.People can live without solid food for a few weeks, but we
    cannot live without water for more than a few days. An adult needs about 2â€“3 litres of water each day. That is why giving drinks are so
    important when people lose a lot of water, such as when they have diarrhoea.
  </p>
  <h2>fiber</h2>

  <p>
    Fibre is a mixture of different carbohydrates which are not digested like other nutrients but pass through the gut nearly unchanged. Foods rich in fibre are â€˜kochoâ€™;
     vegetables like cabbage, â€˜kostaâ€™, carrots, cassava; fruits like banana and avocado; peas and beans; whole-grain cereals like wheat flour and refined maize or sorghum.
